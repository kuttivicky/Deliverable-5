Deliverable 5 flightAware
# Description
We tried to develop a Interactive Database based on flightaware.com 
This is built using Angular for frint end and Spring boot for back end
# How to Run
## Front-end
```
npm start
```
Use this command to run the Angular.js program
## Back-end
Open the file in preferred IDE we used IntelliJ and click Run.
As long as this server is running we can access the database in the browser.
We used Postman as the API testing tool before actually implementing the front-end application.
